# Dynamic Pricing Model for Used Cars   

This project is all about creating a **smart pricing system** for used cars, helping **dealerships** and **online platforms** price cars in a way that‚Äôs **competitive, fair, and profitable**.  

‚úÖ The goal is to ensure:  
- **Customers** get a good deal   
- **Companies (dealerships)** maximize profits   
- **Prices reflect** both the car's true value and market conditions

## Business Understanding  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Market Overview: Used Car Industry in India  
The used car market in India is growing fast due to:  

- **Affordability** ‚Äì More middle-class buyers prefer second-hand cars.  
- **Online Marketplaces** ‚Äì Platforms like OLX, CarDekho, Cars24.  
- And many...

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Problems  
- **Overpricing** ‚Äì Reduces sales and slows inventory movement.  
- **Underpricing** ‚Äì Leads to loss for dealers.  
- **Slow Sales** ‚Äì Cars remain unsold, increasing storage costs.  
- **Lack of Price Transparency** ‚Äì Customers hesitate due to unpredictable pricing.  

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Who Benefits?  
- **Dealerships & Online Platforms** ‚Äì Need a pricing tool to maximize profits.  
- **Car Buyers** ‚Äì Want fair pricing and transparency.  
- **Car Sellers** ‚Äì Need competitive pricing to sell their old cars faster.  

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Benefits  
- **Higher Sales Conversions**  
- **Better Profit Margins** 
- **Optimized Inventory Management**  
- **Data-Driven Pricing**

## Data Understanding

- **Brand:** Car manufacturer  
- **Model:** Specific car model
- **Year:** Manufacturing year of the vehicle 
- **Age:** Age of the vehicle in years  
- **kmDriven:** Total kilometers driven by the vehicle  
- **Transmission:** Type of transmission (M/A)  
- **Owner:** Ownership status (1/2)  
- **FuelType:** Type of fuel
- **PostedDate:** When the car listing was posted

- **Descriptive Statistics:-** \
    **Observations**:
    - `Year` (1986 - 2024) ‚Üí Dataset includes cars from 1986 to 2024.
    - `Age` (0 - 38 years) ‚Üí Some cars are very old, others are brand new.
![year_vs_askPrice](https://github.com/gagandeepsingh04/Dynamic_pricing_of_used_cars/blob/main/yearVsPrice.png)
- **Categorical Data Analysis:-** \
    **Observations**:
    - `Brand` (39 unique values) ‚Üí 39 different car brands (e.g., Maruti Suzuki is the most frequent).
    - `Model` (400 unique values) ‚Üí High variety of car models (e.g., City is most common).
    - `Transmission` (2 unique values: Manual, Automatic) ‚Üí Majority are manual (4666 cars).
    - `Owner` (2 unique values: 1, 2) ‚Üí Most are first-owner (4596 cars).
    - `FuelType` (3 unique values: Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid/CNG) ‚Üí Diesel is most common (3520 cars).
    - `PostedDate` (12 unique values) ‚Üí Most listings are recent (Nov-24 is most frequent).
- **Missing Values** ‚Äì `kmDriven` have some missing values, replaced by median.
- **Outliers & Anomalies** ‚Äì remove outliers from both `age` and `kmDriven`.
- **Binning of data** - binned data of `Age` and `Year`
- **Log Transformed** - `kmDriven`, `AskPrice`.

![log_transformed_AskPrice](https://github.com/gagandeepsingh04/Dynamic_pricing_of_used_cars/blob/main/logTransformed_askPrice.png)
- **Feature Relationship** ‚Äì `Age` and `Year` shows good relationship with `AskPrice`.
- **Feature Distributions Analysis** ‚Äì checked distribution of `AskPrice`, `Age`, `Year` and `kmDriven`.
- **Removed Duplicate Rows**

## Data Preparation  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection
`Brand`, `Year`, `Age`, `log_kmDriven`, `Transmission`, `Owner`, `FuelType`, `PostedMonth`, `AskPrice`

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering  
- Encoding Categorical Variables  
`Brand`, `Transmission`, `FuelType`, `PostedMonth`

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Splitting  
- **Train-Test Split** ‚Äì 80% for training, 20% for testing.
- 
## Modeling

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing the Right Model  
Since we are predicting car prices (a continuous variable), this is a regression problem. Possible models:  

- **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **polynomial Regression**

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Findout the Best Degree of the Polynomial Regression.
- Uses Regularization (Lasso/Ridge) to prevent overfitting.
